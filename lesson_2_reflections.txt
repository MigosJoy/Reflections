<!-- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? -->
It creates a snapshot of all the files within that directory in their current states.
If a new file is added to that directory it then displays the addition of that file within the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is different from the working directory in that the working directory contains all files that are in the repository. The staging area simply
identifies which files the user would like to add to the commit before he or she makes it and only changes in those files will get added to the commit.
